# Drone Package Delivery System

This project includes three main codes for different stages of solving the drone delivery problem:

1. **ex1.py:** Implements the basic search problem for drone delivery, calculating distances, possible actions, state transitions, and heuristics. This code sets up the fundamental problem structure and defines the basic mechanics of the drone delivery system.

2. **ex2.py:** Enhances the basic search by adding a heuristic-based agent, focusing on optimizing drone actions using distance calculations, rewards, and state transitions. This code improves the efficiency of the delivery system by incorporating heuristic methods to guide the drones' actions more intelligently.

3. **ex3.py:** Introduces a reinforcement learning agent that uses Q-learning with Boltzmann exploration to learn optimal delivery policies through trial and error. This code allows the system to adapt and improve over time by learning from the outcomes of different actions, making the delivery process more effective.

Each of these codes builds upon the previous one, moving from a basic problem setup to enhanced decision-making and finally to adaptive learning.
